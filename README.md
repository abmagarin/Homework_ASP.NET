# Homework_ASP.NET
 
By completing the ASP.NET Core MVC example application on MSDN, you have the opportunity to earn extra 10 points, which can be counted towards the end of term lecture exam.
To earn points, you must complete the followings:
Read the documentation on the following page:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio
Register on Gitlab or Github and upload the steps to develop the application in the documentation to your own git repository. Upload the completed project in 10 commits, and the chapter titles of the documentation (Get started, Add a controller, Add a view, etc.) must be displayed in each commit message.
When you are done with the development, let me know at the end of the Server Side lectures and we will look at the completed solution together.
In the example project MS SQL relational database is used, if this is not suitable you can use PostgreSQL (e.g. if you are developing on Linux operating system).
Task deadline: 2024.10.21
